The Selenium Expert goes through your selenium test cases suggesting improvements, giving tips and even lets you apply them with a single click. Recently, Selenium IDE has brought a some improvements that will break some test scripts. The good news is that most of the essential breaking changes introduced in Selenium IDE 1.0.10 have been incorporated into the Selenium Expert. This should make your migration task a few clicks affair.\n\nOnce you install the Selenium Expert plugin, an Expert pane will be available in Selenium IDE. Use the Selenium Expert is really simple.\n- First click on the Inspect button to let the Selenium Expert check all the test cases in the current test suite.\n- The suggestions from the Expert will be shown in the Expert pane, nicely grouped by the category of the tip. All commands will also be marked with red i icon.\n- You can check all your test cases to see the affected commands. (Individual control and better navigation will be in the next version).\n- Back up every thing first then select the groups you want to fix automatically.\n- Click Fix to let Selenium Expert apply the changes to the suite. The fixes are NOT undo-able hence the need to backup your tests.\n\nCurrently the following inspections are bundled with the Selenium Expert:-\n\n- Detect and fix Boolean attribute usage\n- Detect and fix non-lowercase style attribute usage\n- Detect unsupported css locators\n\nSee my blog for more details.\n\nAs usual feel free to leave comments, improvements, advise, criticism, problems on my blog at http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/. Please do not use the review here to report issues.\n\nEnjoy ;-)\nSamit Badle","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/52/52105.png?src=api&modified=1530208891","width":"700","height":"395","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/52/52105.png?src=api&modified=1530208891","thumbnailWidth":"320","thumbnailHeight":"181","caption":"The suggestions from the Selenium Expert!"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/52/52104.png?src=api&modified=1530208891","width":"700","height":"395","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/52/52104.png?src=api&modified=1530208891","thumbnailWidth":"320","thumbnailHeight":"181","caption":"The Selenium Expert pane"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/52/52106.png?src=api&modified=1530208892","width":"700","height":"395","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/52/52106.png?src=api&modified=1530208892","thumbnailWidth":"320","thumbnailHeight":"181","caption":"The suggestion fixed by the Expert."}],"averageRating":3,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/selenium-expert-selenium-ide/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/tag/selenium-expert-selenium-ide-plug-in/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/182682/selenium_expert_selenium_ide-0.25-fx.xpi?src=api","size":21994,"developerComments":"I would greatly appreciate all feedback, comments, suggestions as usual.\n\nEnjoy ;-)","reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/selenium-expert-selenium-ide/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":12,"totalDownloads":912816,"weeklyDownloads":293,"dailyUsers":8746,"updateDate":1355761568000,"supportURL":"http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/"},{"id":"FireXPath@pierre.tholence.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/11/11900-32.png?modified=1328115857","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/11/11900-64.png?modified=1328115857"},"name":"FirePath","type":"extension","version":"0.9.7.1.1-signed.1-signed","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Pierre Tholence","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/user/pierre-tholence/?src=api"},"description":"FirePath is a Firebug extension that adds a development tool to edit, inspect and generate XPath 1.0 expressions, CSS 3 selectors and JQuery selectors (Sizzle selector engine).","fullDescription":"With FirePath you can:\n* Edit XPath expressions, CSS3 selectors and JQuery selectors (Sizzle selector engine) with auto completion for XPath (using TAB or up and down arrows).\n* Evaluate the expression/selector on any HTML or XML documents.\n* Display the result of evaluations in a Firebug-like DOM tree.\n* Highlight the results directly on the document displayed by Firefox (works only with HTML documents).\n* Generate an XPath expression or a CSS selector for an element by right clicking on it and selecting \"Inspect in FirePath\" in the context menu.\n* Define the evaluation context (parent) of an expression/selector.\n* Choose the document in which to evaluate the expression/selector (only applicable for HTML documents with frames or iframes).\n\nFirePath 0.9.7 requires Firefox 3.5 to 6.0 and Firebug 1.4 to 1.8.*\nNote that the XPath auto completion does not work with Firebug 1.6 and higher\n\n\n\nAuthor:\nPierre Tholence\nFirePath has been developed during my master project at DB4ALL.\nDB4ALL.com is a Start-Up at the Database Laboratory at EPFL funded by Innogrant.
